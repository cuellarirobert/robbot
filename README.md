# robbot

## Project Description 
RobBot is a Python-based conversational bot powered by OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo. It leverages the machine learning models for speech recognition and text-to-speech tasks. RobBot loads information from a CSV file and uses this data to provide responses to user queries that are similar to the content found within the loaded documents. A robot that answers questions about me using ChatGPT3.5.

$$ Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

* You have a Windows/Mac/Linux machine running Python 3.x.
* You have an OpenAI API key. If you don't have one, you can create it here.
* You have installed the dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file.

# Installation and Setup
Follow these steps to get the project set up:

* Clone the repository to your local machine.
`git clone [[repo link]](https://github.com/cuellarirobert/robbot)`

* Navigate to the cloned project directory.

* Install the required dependencies using pip.
`pip install -r requirements.txt`


* Set your OpenAI API key as an environment variable.
`export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-key'`

# Usage
To use RobBot, follow these steps:

Run the script using Python.

`python script_name.py`

The bot will initialize and begin accepting voice input.

When you ask a query, the bot will find the most similar responses based on the documents loaded from the "robbot.csv" file, and then respond with synthesized speech.

To stop the bot, simply interrupt the process.

NOTE: Feel free to customize the CSV file associated with this script for a more tailored bot experience.
